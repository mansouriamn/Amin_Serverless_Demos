				Graphql vs REST API

Let's imagine we have a database of authors and their books. Authors have 10 attributes and so
do books. every author might have many books. If we want to get a list of authors that will also
include the name of each book, this is what will happen in a REST API.

First we have to send a request to get a list of authors. Although we just want the name of the
authors, we will receive the name plus all of the attributes of the authors. Then we will have to
filter the author names and send another request to the API, this time asking for all the books
the author has. Although we just need the name of the books, we will receive the name and all
of the attributes of the books as well and we will have to filter to get just the book names.
If we have 5 authors, this means we will have to send 5 requests to get information for each 
author.

With GraphQL we specify that we want the author's name and book title and that's exactly what 
we will get after sending the request.
