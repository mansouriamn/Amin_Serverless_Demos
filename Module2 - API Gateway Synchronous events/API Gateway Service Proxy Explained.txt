				API Gateway Service Proxy Explained


Looking at the diagram below we can see that a client is sending a request to the API Gateway.
The API Gateway is forwarding the request to the lambda function and from there the request will
be forwarded to dynamodb

Client ----> API Gateway ----> Lambda Function ----> DynamoDb

API gateway service proxy can send the request directly from API Gateway to DynamoDB after
removing the lambda function. This will reduce costs and decrease the latency since we're not
invoking a lambda function in the middle of this process.
