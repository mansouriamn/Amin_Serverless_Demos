			API Gateway Stage Variables


Stage variables act like environment variables and can be used to change the behavior of your 
API Gateway methods for each deployment stage; for example, making it possible to reach a 
different back end depending on which stage the API is running on.


1- Create an API Gateway
*	Open API Gateway
*	Click "Build" Rest API
*	Create New API and call it "Hello World API" and click "Create API"
*	Click "Actions", then "Create Method", then click "Get" and click check mark
*	Select HTTP integration type and paste "http://${stageVariables.url}" in the "Endpoint URL" box and hit save.
*	Select "Get" method, click "Actions" and select "Deploy API"
*	Click "New Stage" and place "Dev" as name and hit deploy

Note: The value "http://${stageVariables.url}" means that api gateway will look for a variable called "url" and use its value
in front of "http://". 

Note: After hitting deploy method, the url will return "Internal server error" since there is no value defined in stage variable.

2- Create Stage variables
*	Select the Dev stage
*	Select the Stage Variables tab
*	Click Add stage variable
*	Enter "url" in the "Name" box and enter "example.com" in the value box and click check mark
*	Select the "Get" method and click the "Actions" menu
*	Click "Deploy API" and select "Dev" asthe stage and click "Deploy"
*	Now the "https://fj911qxpa4.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Dev" will connect you to the example.com page

3- Create second stage variable
*	Click "Stages" from the left and hit the "Create" button
*	Provide Stage name "Prod", select the last deployment and hit create.
*	Click the "Stage Variables" tab and click "Add Stage Variable"
*	In the "Name" box place "url", and in the "Value" box place "neverssl.com"
*	Click "Resources", select the "Get" method click "Actions", select "DeployAPI", select "Prod" and hit "Deploy"

Now the Prod link connects to one URL while the Dev link connects to another URL while both are still using the same API Gateway.

Note: If we want to use different stage variable for lambda functions Aliases, we can use the following when creating API gateway and Lambda functions
Considering the name of our lambda function is Helloworld.

Helloworld:${stageVariables:lambdaAlias}
