			Python Application Sending Events to Custom Event Bus

Create a python application that can read your name, lastname and company you work at
and then send an event to custom event bus in Event Bridge. This event will be forwarded to a
lambda function and the contents would be printed out.

Create a pyhton application
1- Create a pyhton application and call it myapp.py (Refer to the file in this folder)

Create a lambda function:
1- Create a python lambda function and call it "Register-User"
2- Paste the following code in the code section

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    name = event["detail"]["name"]
    lastname = event["detail"]["lastname"]
    company = event["detail"]["company"]
    
    print(name, lastname, company)
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
    }

This code will wait for an event that has a detail section and the values name, lastname and 
company underneath.

Create an event bus

1- Create a custom event bus using the following steps
2- Open event bridge --> Click event buses --> Click "Create Event Bus"
3- Name the event bus "User-Registry" --> Enable Event Archive --> Enable Schema Discovery
4- Hit create
5- Click "Rules" on the left --> Select the "User-Registry" bus under "Event bus"
6- Click "Create Rule"
7- Name the rule 'New-registration-event' --> Select "Rule with an event pattern" and hit next
8- Scroll to the bottom and select "Custom Patterns" and paste the following pattern then click next.

{
  "source": ["my-event"],
  "detail-type": ["Send Event to Registration Service"]
}

9- As a target select AWS Service --> Lambda Function --> "Register-User" and click finish.


Test Application

1- Open python application and hit run
2- Open lambda logs and you should see the logs in cloudwatch.

This proves that the application genrated events and the events were sent to the custom event bus
and the event was forwarded to the user registration lambda function.

3- Scroll to the bottom of the page in event bridge and select Schemas.
4- Under "Discovered Schema Registry" you will see the a new schema added that belongs to user
registration
