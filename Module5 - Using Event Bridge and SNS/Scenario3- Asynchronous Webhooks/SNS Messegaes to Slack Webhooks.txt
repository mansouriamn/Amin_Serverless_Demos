			SNS messages to Slack webhooks

If we want to send SNS notifications to Slack, Microsoft teams, chime or other messaging
applications we can do so by forwarding SNS messages to the applications webhooks.

Applications like slack or Microsoft teams can accept messages using webhooks. We 
need to enable webhooks in these applications first. To enable webhooks in slack 
visit https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks. Now our slack application is ready
to accept requests. These applications only accept JSON messages but unfortunately
SNS can't send JSON messages. So for this reason we will have to send our message to
a lambda function first. The function will accept the message from SNS and convert it 
into JSON and send it to Slack. 

Create a lambda function and place the following code in the fucntion for this purpose.

#!/usr/bin/python3.6
import urllib3 
import json
http = urllib3.PoolManager() 
def lambda_handler(event, context): 
    url = "https://hooks.chime.aws/incomingwebhooks/xxxxxxx"
    msg = {
        "Content": event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']
    }
    encoded_msg = json.dumps(msg).encode('utf-8')
    resp = http.request('POST',url, body=encoded_msg)
    print({
        "message": event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'], 
        "status_code": resp.status, 
        "response": resp.data
    })

Replace the value in front of "url" with webhooks url of your slack application. Read the sns
message and save it in the "msg" variable. Encode the json message "encoded_msg". Send your 
http request. If you get a 200 response this means your message was sent successfully.
