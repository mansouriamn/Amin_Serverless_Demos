			Best practices for building modern serverless applications

1- Run the serverless application in the cloud:
	Cloud can abstract the backend infrastructure for the serverless application

2- Serverless apps can scale, update, deploy and incorporate reversible changes independantly
	without impacting other elements in the system.

3- To integrate microservices, use integration services like sqs, sns, eventbridge, kinises and etc 

4- Use infrastructure as code to deploy infrastructure for your application

5- Serverless apps are built around the business logic of the business

6- Serverless apps might have several purpose built data stores for each service

7- Serverless apps can connect their services using synchronous and asynchronous methods to 
	achieve decoupling 


			Challenges for adopting serverless best practices


1- Organizational structure:
	For many organizations, it means changing how you think about your code, structure your
	teams, deploy your software, and operationalize your applications.

2- Service and data store boundries:

3- Managing distributed data and their transactions

4- Many moving pieces and deployments

5- Monitoring and troubleshooting distributed applications
