For example a serverless application cosntantly throwing errors. DynamoDB logs show ProvisionedThroughputExceededException error messages.
If we use AWS SDK's, it will implements retry logic automatically and also implements an Exponential Backoff Algorithm for better flow control.
The concept of exponential backoff algorithm means that we will use longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses.
If after a minute the retries don't succeed, the problem might be the provision throughput not
the request rate. Set the maximum number of retries to stop around one minute. If the request was not
successful investigate the provisioned through put.
