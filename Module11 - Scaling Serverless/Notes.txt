one benefit of serverless applications is the ability to update one service or component without
affecting other services or components. But if we scale one service, how would it affect other
services? These services all have different quotas that might affect each other. 

As our solutions evolve and usage patterns become clearer, we will optimize cost and 
performance over time, we will find how to scale the best way that supports our workloads 
instead of trying to scale infinitely on all components.
