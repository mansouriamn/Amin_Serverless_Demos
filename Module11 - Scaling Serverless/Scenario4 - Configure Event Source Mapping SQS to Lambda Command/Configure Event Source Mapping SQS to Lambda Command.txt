The following example uses the AWS CLI to map a function named my-function to an Amazon SQS 
queue that is specified by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), with a batch size of 5 and a batch
window of 60 seconds.

aws lambda create-event-source-mapping --function-name my-function --batch-size 5 \
--maximum-batching-window-in-seconds 60 \
--event-source-arn arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue
